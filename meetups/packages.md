# Extending your code through pip, easy_install, and packages

_A Primer for Women Who Code ATX_

## Packages and importing

## Pip and easy_install

When getting started with pip, you're actually going to install it with
easy_install. Pip is a package itself. To get it, you are going to invoke
easy_install, the original Python package installer, from your command line like
this:

    easy_install pip

You may have to use sudo.

### Pitfalls of pip

Never ever use sudo with pip. You will corrupt your Python installation on your
machine. It's much better to use virtual environments (for example, with the
packages virtualenv or virtualenvwrapper. I prefer the latter.), which we can
talk about in this session or the next one.
