# Objects and OOO with Python

_A Primer for Women Who Code ATX_

## Catching up on Python

Python is a programming language. In its most basic form, we use variables and functions (or methods) just like in algebra. If you can think in variables in math, you can follow Python code. You may find yourself looking for references a lot of the time, but the basics really are just math.

## What do you mean by "object"?

An object in programming is essentially a thing that can have actions done to it. An object can be defined.

## Everything is an object

Did you know everything in Python is an object? Yes, every single thing in Python is considered an object, from the string that you input to the class that groups variables and methods/functions together to the classes themselves.

## Object-Oriented Thinking

When we talk about thinking in an object-oriented way, we are talking about how we design programs. There's _procedure-based_ programming, which thinks in functions and actions, and then _object-oriented_ programming, which thinks in elements and how they interact. In short, you can design around what you do (the procedure) or around what you are manipulating (the objects). Generally, Python programs get designed around the objects they manipulate. While you still can code procedurally with Python, the more complicated stuff boils down to objects.

## Advanced users: Python is not like Java

Python and Java approach OOP in different ways. A Python project does not _have_ to use classes, as noted above.
