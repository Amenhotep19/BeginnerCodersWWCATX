# Using Errors to Fix Your Code

_A Primer for Women Who Code ATX_

## Errors in Python

As a feature of its design, Python does not let errors pass silently. That means
that whenever the Python interpreter encounters an error, it will tell you and
stop trying to run the code. This feature can be very useful for the beginner
who wants to understand their code.

## Troubleshooting your code


## The stack trace

When your code raises an error, the interpreter (in your terminal) displays a
*stack trace*.

Want to see one live? Check out the [errors Juypter notebook](../examples/errors.ipynb)
for interactive code.

## Python Koans

A great way to learn more about errors and stack traces *and* learn Python at
the same time is to run the Python Koans.

Install them through
