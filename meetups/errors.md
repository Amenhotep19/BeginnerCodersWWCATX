# Using Errors to Fix Your Code

_A Primer for Women Who Code ATX_

## Errors in Python

As a feature of its design, Python does not let errors pass silently. That means
that whenever the Python interpreter encounters an error, it will tell you and
stop trying to run the code. This feature can be very useful for the beginner
who wants to understand their code.

## The stack trace

When your code raises an error, the interpreter (in your terminal) displays a
_stack trace_.

Want to see one? Check out the [errors Juypter notebook](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nimbinatus/BeginnerCodersWWCATX/blob/gh-pages/examples/errors.ipynb)
for the input and output of some code.

## Troubleshooting your code

You can use the stack trace to work your way back through your code to figure
out how it works.

## Python Koans

A great way to learn more about errors and stack traces _and_ learn Python at
the same time is to run the Python Koans.

Install them through
